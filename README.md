# MMG-Expansion-Traders
### Installation & Usage
* Add market files to your yourMissionName\Profiles\ExpansionMod\Market folder.
* Add MMG.json to your Profiles\ExpansionMod\traders folder.

* Copy and paste the line inside Expansion/Traders/greenmounatain.map and add that to your mpmissions\expan.chernarusplus\expansion\traders greenmounataintraders.map file (the location of the trader is kinda bad so I recommend changing the location. if use are using the default trader locations from expansion mod it will be behind the building supplys trader.)
